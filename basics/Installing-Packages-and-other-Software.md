## Python 3.x

For most of the example code snippets we present in the articles we assume some basic knowledge of the Python 3.x programming language and environment.

## Package: requests

The [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io) library is used to send oneM2M requests via http to the oneM2M CSE.

It can be installed using the *pip* package manager:

```sh
pip install requests
```
